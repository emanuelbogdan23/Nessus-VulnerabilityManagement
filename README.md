# Nessus Vulnerability Management

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is designed to enhance the security of local virtual machines hosted on VMWare Workstation. It leverages Nessus Essentials to identify and address potential security weaknesses within the VM environment. This project facilitates credentialed scans, offering in-depth insights into vulnerabilities, and provides remediation guidance to fortify your system's defenses. With the capability to perform rescan verifications, it ensures the effectiveness of remediation efforts.
<br />

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b> 
- <b>VMWare Workstation</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>


<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<p> In the process of setting up my lab environment, I performed the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Installed <strong>VMware Player</strong>, a critical virtualization software that allows me to create and manage virtual machines on my computer. This software serves as the foundation for my virtualized environment.</li>
  <li>Secured the <strong>Windows 10 ISO file</strong>, a prerequisite for installing the Windows 10 operating system within my virtual machine. This ISO file provides the platform for my vulnerability management tasks. I also initiated the installation of Windows 10 within my virtual machine.</li>
  <li>Installed <strong>Nessus Essentials</strong>, the vulnerability scanner. This tool will be my primary means of conducting scans and identifying potential vulnerabilities within my lab environment.</li>
  <li>Created a dedicated virtual machine using VMware Player. This virtual environment acts as an isolated workspace for installing Windows 10 and executing vulnerability scans.</li>
</ul>
<br />


<h3>To Ensure Connectivity with the Virtual Machine (VM)</h3>
<p>Connecting with your virtual machine is the essential first step in our vulnerability management journey. Below are the key actions I took to ensure a seamless connection:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Accessing the VM:</strong> I started the VM and opened the command line within the VM. There, I ran the "ipconfig" command to find the VM's IPv4 address.</li>
  <li><strong>Pinging the VM:</strong> With the VM's IP address, I pinged it from my local machine. I used a continuous ping like so: "ping 192.168.1.38 -t".</li>
  <li><strong>Timeout Troubles:</strong> The ping timed out because of the VM's firewalls. In response, I disabeled the VM's firewall. NOTE: This might not be suitable in a production setting, but since we are in a controlled lab environment it is ok.</li>
  <li><strong>Firewall Deactivation:</strong> To dismantle the VM's firewall, I navigated to the Windows Firewall settings. From there, I turned off the firewall for all three profiles: domain, private, and public.</li>
  <li><strong>Successful Ping:</strong> With the firewall turned off, the ping from my local computer was sucessful, validating that we had established a clear channel to the VM.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these measures in place, I set the stage for comprehensive scans and tests in our lab environment.</p>

<h3>Creating the First Non-Credentialed Scan in Nessus</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Creating a New Scan:</strong> In Nessus Essentials, I initiated a new scan. I chose to perform a basic network scan, giving it a name like "Windows 10 Single Host" for easy reference. For the scan target, I simply pasted our virtual machine's IP address.</li>
  <li><strong>Launching the Scan:</strong> With our scan configured and ready to go, I clicked "Launch" to initiate the scan. Nessus provides logs to keep you informed (see below).</li>
</ol>
<p>The scan is now complete! I reviewed the results, which Nessus categorized by severity. Critical and high vulnerabilities often take precedence in many organizations, but we also checked info, low, and medium findings. Keep in mind that, since we performed a non-credentialed scan, the depth of vulnerability detection was limited. Next up, we'll prepare the virtual machine to accept authenticated scans for more comprehensive results.</p>

<h3>Configuring VM for Credentialed Scans</h3>
<p>In this next step, I set up the virtual machine to accept credentialed scans. This will allow us to provide credentials to Nessus and perform a more comprehensive scan. We'll then compare the results of this new scan with the previous non-credentialed scan.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enabling Remote Registry:</strong> To begin, I enabled the remote registry service on the virtual machine. This service allows the Nessus scanner to connect to the computer's registry and examine it for insecure configurations, such as deprecated cipher suites.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjusting User Account Control:</strong> In this step, I made changes to the User Account Control (UAC) settings, although it's essential to note that this is not recommended for production environments. We temporarily disabled the UAC to facilitate the remote scan.</li>
  <li><strong>Editing the Registry:</strong> We accessed the Windows Registry Editor and navigated to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System," I created a new DWORD value named "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy" and set its value to 1. This key helps further disable UAC restrictions for remote accounts used during scanning.</li>
  <li><strong>Editing the Nessus Scan:</strong> Returning to Nessus Essentials, I edited the scan I initially created. In the scan configuration, I added Windows credentials, using the username "admin" and the password I had set up during the VM creation.</li>
  <li><strong>Running the Credentialed Scan:</strong> With the credentials added to the scan, I launched the scan, focusing on a more in-depth assessment.</li>
  <li><strong>Inspecting Scan Results:</strong> After the credentialed scan, I reviewed the results. As seen below, I observed a significant difference in the number and severity of vulnerabilities detected compared to the initial non-credentialed scan. This reinforces the importance of running credentialed scans to uncover vulnerabilities more comprehensively.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Some of the steps I did involved circumventing typical security controls, and they should be used judiciously in a controlled environment for testing and learning purposes. In a real-world corporate setting, adhering to established security policies is crucial.</p>

<h3>Vulnerability Remediation</h3>
<p>In this part of the lab, my primary goal was to fortify the security of our local virtual machines by taking several crucial steps to remediate vulnerabilities.  Here's a detailed breakdown of what I did:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Operating System Updates:</strong> Recognizing that the Windows 10 operating system forms the foundation of our virtualized environment, I ensured that it received regular updates. These updates not only introduce new features and improvements but, more importantly, patch known security vulnerabilities. By staying current with these updates, we enhanced the overall stability and security of our system.</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency and Third-Party Software Updates:</strong> I extended my focus beyond the core operating system to include all dependencies and third-party software used in our virtual environment. These components often play a critical role in the system's functionality, and outdated software can be a potential avenue for security breaches. Thus, I diligently sought out and applied updates for these components to eliminate known vulnerabilities and strengthen our security posture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these steps, I worked to secure the virtualized environment against potential threats by addressing known vulnerabilities and keeping all software components up to date. This proactive approach laid a solid foundation for our vulnerability management efforts and represented a critical stride in enhancing the security of our local virtual machines.</p>
